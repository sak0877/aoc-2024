# Advent of Code 2024
My first time attempting the Advent of Code, starting with the 2024 edition. Solved each problem with a mix of programming languages I am familiar with.  
* Day 1: Python
    * My first AOC problem
    * If anything, perhaps it would have been better to not destroy my list parameters
* Day 2: Java
    * Had a hard time initially trying to only use arrays
    * Java's verbosity also does not make it ideal for these problems
* Day 3: Python
    * For this solution I challenged myself to make a maximally unreadable solution
    * This posed a new challenge trying to debug a one-line program with no variables
* Day 4: Kotlin
    * I wanted to do this one in Kotlin for a change 
    * Getting all the diagonals of the input matrix for Part 1 was quite a challenge
    * Kotlin's nice features like when statements were useful here
